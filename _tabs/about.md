Graduated as an Electrical Engineer, I started my career working on Embedded Systems. My current role is chip architect for AI inference chip targeted at autonomous driving market.

I find my passion in lowest working principles of any system, especially hardware designs and firmware/low-level-software from baremetal to operating systems. Although for the past 10+ years of professional work I was mostly focusing on coding, the interest on IC design never went away. AI advancements in recent years have brought my attention to AI researches, applications, and the related hardware trends.

Outside of technical work, I enjoy reading books, hiking and skiing.
