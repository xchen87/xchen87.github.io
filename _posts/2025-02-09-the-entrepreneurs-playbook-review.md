## Principle#1 Find a Marketplace Challenge That Needs to Be Solved or Improved

Most entrpreneurs made mistake trying to start with ideas that are new and unique. This is usually inefficient. Problem is most of those ideas are not yet feasible.\
**Investigate what products are in the marketplace and make yours better**\
**When others see problems, you should look for opportunities**\
**Don't give customers what they say they want, give them what they need**\
Often customers have needs, but don't really know what could better address their needs before you present the correct idea. E.g. Smart phones are not what customers forsee they need, but Steve Jobs is able to present the product to have customers realize that's indeed what they need.\
**Utilize the Pareto 80/20 rule**\
Approximately 80% of company's revenue or profit comes directly from 20% of its resources, like product lines, customers, and even employees.

## Principle#2 A Better Mousetrap Is Not Enough
**Build a moat**\
Think about how to build a moat from the very beginning. Start asking the question: how are you different?\
**Financing the venture**\
Don't do a business plan for projecting out five years. No one knows what's going to happen during those time. But do have a good idea how much is going to be required to get started.\
*Rule of thumb*: figure out how much to keep company going for a year without any revenues, then add 30%.\
Potential investers are going to want to see that you have invested your own money. No outsiders are going to risk their money on someone who is treating the startup like a theoretical exercise.\
**Involve your customers in developing the company's future**

## Principle#3 If You Aint' Passionate About Your Idea, No One Else Will
If you are not passionate about the idea, you should not be doing it.\
After that, one should look at it from a different angle:
+ Is It Feasible?
+ Can I do it?
+ Is it worth doing?
+ Do I want to do it?
It's extremely important to select a business that satisfies your personal goals, involves the kind of work you like to do, are good at, and fits your lifestyle.

**Don't get in your own way, learn to empower others**
+ The business may never grow bigger than one person can manage effectively.
+ The company can't move quickly, if everything has to flow through the chief executive. This is a bottleneck.
+ Can't get best ideas out from the other people. "Why should I try my best" They ask; "The CEO is just going to do what he/she wants anyway"
+ It's exhausting.

## Principle#4 Experiment with ALBR - Act, Learn, Build, Repeat.
The world is going to change. There will be uncertainty. Don't over plan/think, the best way to deal uncertainty is to *act* the way into the future you desire.

## Principle#5 If You Are Not Failing (Occasionally), You Are Not Aiming High Enough
Embrace setbacks, but don't fail in a way that will wipe you out of the game.\
**Calculated Risk-Taker, not just a risk-taker**\
**Recognize the risks. Warn friends and family members that the investement may fail**\
**Learn from the failures, if you can't learn from it, then the failure is not worth it**

## Principle#6 Work Hard
**There is no such thing as work-life balance**\
Not for a person that want to be a high achiever, or want to be successful entreprenuer. Desiring work life balance is nothing wrong, but do embrace the fact that will dramatically decrese the chance of being a high achiever in any one area. It'll be more of a work/life choice.\
**Make the most of your time**\
**Prioritizing**

## Principle#7 The Key Entrepreneurial Trait: Knowing how to Spot an Opportunity
**Start from Home**
Ways to juice the thinking:
+ Necessity
+ Pay attention
+ Bring back the suggestion box
+ Think differently
+ No Negative Nellies
+ Study the competition\
**Devote a specific amount of time each day - every day - looking for opportunities**

## Principle#8 Successful Entrepreneurs Are Not Risk-Takers; They are Calculated Risk-Takers
**Try everything to minimize risks**
Some suggestions: Even before taking first steps toward creating anything new, there are things can be done to reduce risks even further.
+ Form a business entity, that provides tax and business flexibility and protects personal assets. Probably start with LLC.
+ Have liability insurance.
+ If have partners, create an operating agreement that covers what happens to the business if one of you dies, gets divorced, becomes ill, or leaves the business.
+ Creat buy/sell agreement.\
**More than money is at risk**\
Time/Missed Opportunities/Professional Reputation/Personal Reputation/Relationships/Physical and Mental Health

## Principle#9 Must have an Advisory Board
**Don't include anyone working in the company**\
**Include the ones that expands network, provides mentoring, different perspective**

## Principle#10 Research the Market; Narrow the Options; Act!
**Do NOT over research, get started is always the most important, things change**\
**Minimum research necessary, especially what competitors are doing**\
**Count the chips, before you begin**\
**Get out into the marketplace as quickly as you can**\
**Don't stay too long**

## Principle#11 There is No Sense Making a Mistake Unless You can Learn From It
**Be Willing to make mistakes**\
**Let the marketplace tell you whether you are right**\
**Analyze the mistakes**\
Always get input from other people, they may see things you don't.\
**Learn from the mistakes of others**

## Principle#12 Most Effective Tool to Solve a Problem or Deal with Crisis? SWOT
+ Strengths
+ Weaknesses
+ Opportunities
+ Threats\
**Use SWOT over both short term and long term goals**\
**SWOT is also investment tool**\
**Prioritize, Work hard, and double check**

## Principle#13 If It Aint' Broke - Break it
**Don't be complacent, Always Improve, Always Get Better**\
**Waiting until you have to change is too late**\
**Constantly performing SWOT analyses, with the team together**

## Principle#14 Be a Mensch
**Shame on me if I believe everyone is going to be honest - But I would like to start there**\
**Trust, but verify**\
**When going to a deal, always expect that the other person will do something (unethical) that I don't**
