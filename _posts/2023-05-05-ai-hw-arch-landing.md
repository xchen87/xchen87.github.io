AI has a long history, but not until recent years it really grabbed everyone's attention and took the center stage of technology world. Despite all the great researches that scientists kept on pushing on AI philosophies, theories, and algorithms, what ultimately enabled this wave of AI explosion is the exponential growth of calculation power offered by hardware advancements.\
This blog's original purpose was to refresh myself and share the knowledge of current AI hardware landscape, also write down my personal takes on the future trends. However as I proceed the contents kept expanding so I decided to break it into a blog series as following:

[1. A Brief History of AI and AI Hardware](../ai-hw-arch-history)<br>
[2. Current AI Hardware Architectures(WIP)]()<br>
[3. Future Trends(WIP)]()
