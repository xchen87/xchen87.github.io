Artificial Intelligence may sound like a fancy and cutting-edge term, it has a long and roller-coaster like history.

## The Dawn (Pre-1960)

The first "artificial intelligence" work was carried out back in 1943 by [McCulloch and Pitts](https://home.csulb.edu/~cwallis/382/readings/482/mccolloch.logical.calculus.ideas.1943.pdf). Based on the theoretical neurophysiology and how neurons communicate in the nervous system, they proposed a computational node modelling (M-P Model) that simulates neuron behavior, and proved that any logical proposition can be encoded to a corresponding neuron network by structuring the nodes differently. Given human brain is a neuron network, this hints it encodes a complicated program, and that it can theoretically be simulated through artifical networks so we can achieve an algorithm that can learn and think. Although from today's view their fixed-threshold modeling of neuron was too simple thus flawed, it paved the way for what will be known as Artificial Intelligence, and inspired cross-disciplinary researches between neuroscience and computation.

Iconic mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing, also believed that building a learning machine that mimics human brain is possible, but with a different approach. In his famous paper published in 1950 [Computing Machinery and Intelligence](https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238), Turning discussed his opinions of how to build a *Learning Machine*, and how to evaluate through *Imitation Game* which is now referred to as *Turning Test*.

In 1956, being proposed by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester, DSRPAI conference took place. It is widely adopted as the "founding event" for AI. In fact, the term *Artificial Intelligence* was first proposed in this event. It was essentially a brainstorm session on different AI related topics. Though itself did not bring any notable break-through, its profounding impact opened a new chapter for AI.
